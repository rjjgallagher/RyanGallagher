# Weather Application
This is a weather application that is still a work in progress. Everything that has been pushed to main thus far is fully functional. The latest version is the branch 
"Assignment6". 

This application is being programmed in Kotlin for android that pulls live data from an API provided by https://openweathermap.org/api. I am applying the object-oriented paradigm and data structures such as lists and maps. Additionally, it'll utilize the Model-view-ViewModel software architectural pattern. The most recent version was an update that implemented Android's Navigation component.

All of the classes for this project can be found via app/src//main/java/com/example/ryangallagher of each branch. Drawables, navigation, and layout xml can be found via app/src/main/res/ of each branch.
